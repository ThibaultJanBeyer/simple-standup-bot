# Work in Progress

- A dead simple open source standup bot
- Based on the [Getting Started ⚡️ Bolt](https://github.com/slackapi/bolt-js-getting-started-app) and [github copilot chat](https://github.com/github-copilot/chat_waitlist_signup/join) output
- Rushed in a week
- neon.tech as db and drizzle as orm
- next.js for the app using mostly https://ui.shadcn.com/ for components
- Running on digitalocean instance monitoring via pm2 https://app.pm2.io/bucket/6495c91365be89c1f189e947/backend/overview/servers
